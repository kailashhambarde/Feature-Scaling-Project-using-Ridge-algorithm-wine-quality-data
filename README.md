# Feature-Scaling-Project-using-Ridge-algorithm-wine-quality-data

For Re-Scaling propose we used Diabetes data set downloaded from UCI website.
In this diabetes data set we applye all rescaling machine learing techinques to find which one is 
better.
We used following Rescaling Techniques here....
1. Min-Max Normalization
2. Standardization
3.Normalization
4.Binarizer


After that we build a project on this techniques on Wine Quality data set from UCI website.
In this project we used Ridge() Machine learing Algorithm..
